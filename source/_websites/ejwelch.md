EJWelch.com is a custom web application with a public facing marketing side and an account based e-commerce side. EJ Welch dealers can log in to access the customer store and place orders. This web app has a Ruby on Rails back end and a Vue.js front end along with Bootstrap Vue 2. This project had a total of 4 developers. I was primarily responsible for the front end styling and several feature additions. I now handle ongoing maintenance and support.
