The Sportmanship Foundation is a custom wordpress build that features a flexible module-based page builder on the back end. It features some custom hover based css animations and custom navigation menu. 100% of the front end of this website code I wrote. It is based on a laravel and node powered base theme proprietary to Matchbox Design Group.
