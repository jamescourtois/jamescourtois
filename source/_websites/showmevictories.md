This was a single-developer build on behalf of Matchbox Design Group for Show Me Victories. This custom wordpress theme is based on the "Kindling" starter theme. It includes a module-based page builder on the back end. I worked closely with a designer to create the assets and animation for the home page "raising hands" feature.
