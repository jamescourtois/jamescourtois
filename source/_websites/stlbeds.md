This was a multi-developer build on behalf of Matchbox Design Group and UPBrand for STL Beds. This custom wordpress theme is based on the "Kindling" starter theme and integrates with WooCommerce. It includes a module-based page builder on the back end and a customized shop. I completed about 60% of the coding for this project.
