ContainerizedResources.com is a custom wordpress theme based on the blank template generated by <a href="htts://underscores.me" target="_blank">Underscores.me</a>. It features a lot of complex layout challenges with overlaying photos, different triangle design aesthetics, and a mobile responsive slider.

I worked closely with the designer to translate their vision and 100% of the theme code was written by me.
