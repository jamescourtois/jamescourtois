THe ITW family of websites are custom wordpress builds that feature a flexible module-based page builder on the back end. There are hover-based css animations as well as looping animates in the background of certain modules. 100% of the front end of these website is code I wrote. It is based on a laravel and node powered base theme proprietary to Matchbox Design Group.
