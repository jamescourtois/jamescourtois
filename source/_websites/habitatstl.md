This was a multi-developer build on behalf of Matchbox Design Group for Habitat for Humanity St. Louis. This custom wordpress theme is based on the "Kindling" starter theme. It includes a module-based page builder on the back end. I completed roughly 50% of the coding for this project, including the heavily customized donation form.
